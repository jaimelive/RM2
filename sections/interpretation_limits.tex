This paper has several limitations.
Firstly, even though I bracketed and attempted to minimize bias, the typical limitations of phenomenological research, especially the ones relating to subjectivity and bias, are exacerbated by the fact that I was the only data analyst / interpreter.
Due to time constraints, only 4 people were interviewed, meaning its unlikely thematic saturation was achieved.
Furthermore, the somewhat sensitive and private nature of intimate experiences, there is a high risk of omission on the participants part, which could have been mitigated by employing other data sources, such as passive observation.
