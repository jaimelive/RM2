This paper has several limitations the reader must keep in mind when reading the discussions and conclusion.
Firstly, even though I attempted to follow the Epoch Process / Bracketing and minimize bias as much as possible, the typical limitations of phenomenological research, especially the ones relating to subjectivity and bias, are exacerbated by the fact that I was the only researcher and data analyst / coder.
In the future this could be corrected by having multiple analysts / coders as a way to mitigate analytical subjectivity.
Additionally, due to time constraints, only 5 people were interviewed, meaning that data saturation was likely not obtained and proper sampling procedures could not observed.
Furthermore, the somewhat sensitive and private nature of intimate experiences, there is a high risk of omission on the participants part, which could have been mitigated by employing other data sources, such as passive observation.
