    abstract = { Intimacy is a topic of importance with respect to many aspects of relationship theory and a variety of academic disciplines. A consideration of the literature reveals much research but little consensus on even such basic issues as a definition of intimacy. Given that, a phenomenological study was done to determine what ordinary people meant by, and experienced as, intimacy. Results of that study revealed seven major components to intimate experiences. These included: non-verbal communication, presence, time, boundary, body, destiny/surprise and transformation. The relationship between these results and previous research is discussed. }

abstract = {This paper focuses on how the emerging social VR systems, as new and unique social interaction spaces that afford high-fidelity and multidimensional physical presence, may support building interpersonal relationships in a more nuanced, immersive, and embodied way. Based on 30 interviews, our investigation focuses on 1) the main reasons why people build and foster interpersonal relationships in social VR; 2) various novel activities through which users can foster relationships in social VR; and 3) the complicated influences of social VR mediated relationships on users’ online and offline social lives. We contribute to better understanding mediated interactive experiences by shedding light on the novel role of social VR in transforming how people meet, interact, and establish connections with others compared to other forms of media. We also provide potential directions to inform the design of future social VR systems to better afford healthy, fulfilling, and supportive interpersonal relationships.},

@inproceedings{moura2021,
abstract = {In this publication, we present artistic and technical developments in creating and presenting dance performances in media art, where embodiment is crucial in the artistic process. We study and compare three distinct performances with dancers and one choreographer in the same dance company between 2009 and 2020. The degree of immersion in performance is then compared between the three pieces, created at Balleteatro, in Porto, addressing the transition from the real to the virtual in the performance perspective, with practical cases and direct observations in the way the audience learns different states of body representation through technological means. We initially present the NUVE performance (2010), interpreted by N{\'{e}} Barros, Co:Lateral (2016--2019), a performance that crosses different realities, and, finally, the transition to the UNA work (2020) that takes place in total virtuality. This publication focuses on the developments, the public experience, and the results obtained in more than 20 exhibitions in different locations, either in theater or auditorium and in conference venues.},
