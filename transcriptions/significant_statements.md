# Significant Statements

## Participants 1

[Motivation to play] Mostly friends. And just having conversations with random people every day. And trying to help people...
... there was a guy who was gonna serve a prison sentence ... for 2.5 years. I just told him: I is what it is, you got caught doing stupid shit. You just gotta do your time. ... He's doing really well now. He's clean, he's got a job and stuff. I helped him as much as I could.
I mean, I've had a couple of intimate relationships [in VRChat], some girlfriends.
At first it was kinda hard, cause of the long distance relationship. But after a while you just got used to it.
But it just got so hard, cause, you know, time zones... we both had jobs and stuff like that, so we just kinda drifter apart.
Oh Yea, Yea. You see that [people getting physical] everywhere you go. I mean, I have done it to people. Yes, but that's only because they like that sort of touchy feely kind of thing.
Yea, I guess it did feel close and intimate [by touching in VR]. But I've never really thought about that.
I mean... VR is... VR is really a big factor when you're having a relationship in this game. I mean, sure, you can play on desktop, you can do that, but it's not the same thing. When you are in VR you get a sense of I'm so close to this person, yet so far away, but it doesn't matter because they're right there in a sense.
It would be closer to a real life relationship if you think about it.
It's that subconscious kind of thinking. You're with them but not really. 
You feel like the person is there, but they are actually not there at the same time.

## Participants 2

People got to be different people, but the same person at the same time. And I was intrigued by that.
... it just felt like a new world, and I just felt happier here than anywhere else I've been for once.
... it's kind of real life kinda, you can enter a place meet new different people. Bad good, it doesn't matter... they're all people in the end. 
... it kinda helps with me, when it comes to my anxiety to then, in real life, actually go do stuff. 
Yea, definitely, I felt like I was there [when using VR]. Everything just felt like a real world experience?
Like, recently I started not doing that [meeting new people] cause I made so many friends. ...  got rid of that experience of ... a new kind of person... People liking things you that you don't like, you now? that's just interesting. Now I'm back here doing that again [meeting new people].
[First VRChat friends] we were playing Murder 4, first time hopping on and the first guy I met on there, he was doing a goofy impression ... it was hilarious and I joined in, and then he introduced me to his friends who were still in the world. So it just became this big group of people. And I was the popular one for a while, which was odd, and then I just became one of them.
[Being the popular one] Felt great but odd at the same time, because I didn't really know how to handle it.
I still think if it wasn't for me hopping in that server and becoming slightly popular for a while that I wouldn't end up here because I would've probably still been in my shell of "antisocialness".
No I haven't surprisingly [experience intimacy]. I know a lot of people have, but for me, I just don't really... it's not that I don't want to it
... on PC you can't really do much, and same thing just being on a call... you can't really do anything, you're just on the other side.
... even here, it's still that same aspect of being on the other side, but being there at the same time, which just feels so much better.
[playing on PC] but you can't really hug or give high fives or show that full expression of yourself, especially on PC you don't even have hands or can't really turn your head. 
So when it comes to VR you get to be there...
... actually showing real affection kind of. It's like a weird wavelength... thing... like you feel like you're there and you can touch them.
I think it's the feeling of being real for me, when I look at it. It's like going out and meeting these people in person.
Like, they're not themselves, but they still have that personally attached to them in the end. And that's what I'm drawn to, personality, so being there in VR, is just like, to me, being there in real life with them.
... me and my friends were hanging out and one of their girlfriends at the time, broke up with them on the spot, like in front of us all
... It wasn't like through text message, where you have to comfort them through text or a video call where you have to look at them be sad you know? You actually can be next to them and show your support and care for the... And that experience was just so sad for them especially but we all comforted him and they felt better. 
we went out into other servers like prison escape and all that and he felt so much better afterwards.
Yea, I definitely say VR is, again my opinion, the best way to socialize. If you can't go out of your house because of COVID or you actually have a problem that keeps you home, then VR is one step to improving through it all and actually still socializing in the end.
How does it make me feel? I don't really feel anything towards it. I've seen people get cuddly and make out and stuff in VR.
... unless they are doing sex in VR than that's kinda like... that's.. they should be doing that somewhere else.
When it comes to just making out or just showing a lot of affection for each other as a couple in like VR, in like public places or with friends around, it's just kind of cheery and really a happy thing to watch because you are watching two people from two entirely different places and fall in love and still show that strong connection... 
I know from myself and a few other people that in VR you don't feel like its a long distance relationship because you feel like you're actually there.
It's a weird topic when it comes to that [long distance relationships], but it feels better in VR. 
... it feels like you're actually with them unlike through a call or through text, where you feel a disconnection.
Because on a call you can't hug them. You can hug your phone, but it just doesn't feel the same.
... you know, you're there, your body is moving, you see it with your own eyes, you're in that world like if you were in real life. So it kinda just feels stronger here, that disconnection feels gone, because you're actually there with each-other.
... when I first hopped on VR, the first thing I did was go to a mirror cause I wanted to observe myself and see this new me.
You know, it's me, my usual self, but different body, different everything. And it made me feel great
... for a long time I was, as people call, a mirror dweller.
... being a mirror dweller I then become more social, because people like me either wanted to observe themselves or feel kind of ... hum... isolated as well, would come here and we'd all chat.
Even though I've been here for a year what always makes me keep looking at myself in the mirror in VR is that the same feeling when I first hopped on never changed. I still feel so happy and different than, hum, here and not, like, my real self. 
It's like that weird feeling, a weird feeling of like it's you, who you think you are, but it's not what you are in real life.
... probably everyone I've ever met, including myself. They don't really like they way they are in real life, so they come to here in VR to become the person they wanted to be.
 Whether it's either one gender or the other, one body type or the other, its just how they wanna be on here, that's what brings them to look at themselves in the mirror and even just socialize at times.
of course some people can feel it, cause "phantom sense", but for me that doesn't bother me if someone tries to hug me
I personally don't feel phantom sense. I know a few people who do, but every-time I ask them about it, they tell me how it's either like a light cold touch or warm even, or others will say it's like a sharp pain, especially if they got, like, shot in VR. 

## Participants 3

I start playing VRChat when the world shut down. It was a easier way to communicate with people instead of being inside doing nothing. 
I got addicted to this game really quickly.
There is just something with this game! There are so many weird nice people and it's amazing.
I feel like this game just hit me really well. I like meeting new people, I might be scared of meeting new people. 
I think the avatar might be easier, cause like, if people don't like it you can just change it.
... this year, I got a girlfriend in here.
I met her [girlfriend] in Easter actually. And I'm meeting her next week again. I'm going to meet her soon again. She lives in Sweden, I will drive 14 hours. I will make it.
Yea, we met in VRChat.
We both were drunk. I just met this girl, and she was Swedish, so I just kept talking. 
So I felt like this is a person I wanna talk with more and continue with talking.
I think it had to be VR. You can like ... when you are interacting with people it's more realistic than texting or video chat. Because like when you're just texting you can't hear their voice, see their actions...
people might be scared of showing their real self, because like... you don't wanna mess this up [possible relationship] showing yourself. Like, me myself, I have some fat... but I don't care that much... but like, some people will judge that and choose not to be your friend because of how you look. 
... the sense of presence in VR as well... It's not a big deal, like I don't have to have it. But  it's more realistic, 
like sleeping together and looking to them next to you.
Yea, people do that a lot [going to sleep together in VR], I do that every day. It feels like you're with the person that you like. Like they're with you. You have a bed pillow, and they feel like they're actually there, but they're not there.
I have been drinking a lot in this game and also another thing I like in VR is drinking and having fun with friends. Like you're still home safe, so like... That's important for me that I'm just sitting here, I might puke here, I'm safe, I'm sitting and still having fun and interacting.
[What did it feel like when you met your girlfriend in person?] More, more like I knew her already. But I found some new parts.
When I got the VR Headset, the game became a completely new experience, I started petting people and sitting by the mirror as well. It's weird, you jump into this game, and all these weird things become normal, you see them every day and you do them as well.

## Participants 4

... like half of the motivation. The other half is talking to people.
A girl ran into me saying that she wants to suicide and the whole lobby came to comfort her.
... I greet that girl before she talked to me. She's like "My whole life is shit I want to tell someone about this now" And she started crying. The whole lobby came here saying that she's not the only one who's fucked.
... people in VRChat often shit talk but that time everyone was spilling their situation and thoughts.
Just friends. And they're important to me.
They are better [compared to real life friends]! They often have the same interests as me.
It would have been the same [making friends while playing on PC instead of VR].
I was muted.
[You were always muted around your friends in VRChat?] Yes, that was the case before. [Interacted using] Discord or in-game pens.
They don't like their voice. Lack of confidence in speech or just don't want to talk.
Yes [got a girlfriend in VRChat], but virtual only. We don't have plans for getting it real.
...laying together on 3 am chatting or just listen to music together [with friends and girlfriend] 
... she [girlfriend] has VR and Full Body Tracking.
I like music. I don't usually talk deep to Taiwanese friends so music could be universal language for us to communicate in some way. 
... laying around together part is like some sort of pajama party.
People usually be very emotional and honest when it's midnight so I could get info from them.
I can feel a bit when someone touched my face or head
Feels bizarre [being touched in VR], it's like ASMR but on your head
... you get to interact and do lot's things more than calls
Traveling virtual worlds. Like touring but in VRChat
Yea, hands movements are better [compared to PC]. Body language helps, but I focus on other things ... Hearing people sharing their stories and traveling
