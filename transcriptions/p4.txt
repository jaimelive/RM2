# Participant 4

I> I'd like to start with motivation. What got you interested in VRChat?
P> Traveling virtual worlds.
I> What did you like about that?
P> Seeing things completely different from the real one and try to understand what the creator might have thought of.
I> Did your motivation change over time? Why do you still play?
P> It's still there but like half of the motivation. The other half is talking to people.
I> Could you tell me about memorable interactions you've had in VR?
P> Yea! A girl ran into me saying that she wants to suicide and the whole lobby came to comfort her.
I> Can you describe it in more detail? What did it feel like?
P> I was just chilling in Japan Shrine, and I greet that girl before she talked to me. She's like "My whole life is shit I want to tell someone about this now" And she started crying. The whole lobby came here saying that she's not the only one who's fucked. Felt unusual, never encountered some shit like this.
I> How did it feel unusual?
P> Like, people in VRChat often shit talking but that time everyone was spilling their situation and thoughts.
I> What did that feel like to you.
P> I don't know. United? 
I> Did you make a lot of friends in VRChat? Can you tell me about those relationships?
P> Just friends. And they're important to me.
I> How do they compare to real life friends?
P> They are better! They often have the same interests as me.
I> Would it have been the same if you were playing the desktop version of the game instead of VR?
P> Same.
I> You do not feel any kind of effect from the fact that you are in VR, and all the extra interaction?
P> Oh! I actually don't know about that. Since I opened my mic at one pint So yea.
I> Opened your mic at one point? What do you mean?
P> I was muted.
I> You were always muted around your friends in VRChat?
P> Yes, that was the case before.
I> How did you interact with them?
P> Discord or in-game pens.
I> Interesting. You do see a lot of "mute by choice" players. Why do you think that is?
P> They don't like their voice. Lack of confidence in speech or just don't want to talk.
I> What about you? Why didn't you talk to your friends before?
P> I can't speak Japanese but I was able to write it.
I> Did you establish any other intimate relationships?
P> Like couple?
I> For example, yes.
P> Yes, but virtual only. We don't have plans for getting it real.
I> Can you tell me about some moments in which you felt intimate with your girlfriend in VR, or with another friend?
P> Like laying together on 3 am chatting or just listen to music together
I> Is your girlfriend using VR as well? Or desktop? 
P> VR and Full Body Tracking.
I> Do those contribute to the feeling of intimacy?
P> Yes. Also I like music. I don't usually talk deep to Taiwanese friends so music could be universal language for us to communicate in some way. Also laying around together part is like some sort of pajama party. People usually be very emotional and honest when it's midnight so I could get info from them.
I> Any sort of "physical" interaction? Such as head pets or hugs and if so, how does it feel ?
P> Not really
I> Do you have any feelings about it? Have you tried it before?
P> I can feel a bit when someone touched my face or head
I> Do you enjoy it?
P> If he/she is not the one I hate, yes! Feels bizarre, it's like ASMR but on your head
I> Do you think VR and VRChat are better than voice or video calls? Do they improve intimacy?
P> Yes. Since you get to interact and do lot's things more than calls
I> Like what? can you tell me more about it? What do you do for example?
P> Traveling virtual worlds. Like touring but in VRChat
I> That would work on the desktop as well right? I mean specifically in VR, with headset and tracking. Does it add anything to the long distance relationship?
P> Yea, hands movements are better. Body language helps, but I focus on other things
I> What do you focus on?
P> Hearing people sharing their stories and traveling
